## Prerequisites

Shipyard runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows (with WSL), all applications run in Docker containers. To use Shipyard you need a recent version of Docker.

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

To install shipyard either use the quick install script:

```shell
curl https://shipyard.run/install | bash
```

or download the appropriate release from GitHub

[https://github.com/shipyard-run/shipyard/releases](https://github.com/shipyard-run/shipyard/releases)

## Running your first blueprint

Blueprints are packages of Shipyard configuration which allow you to run cloud native applications on your computer with Docker

You can find an example blueprint at the following location:

[https://github.com/shipyard-run/blueprints/tree/master/vault-k8s](https://github.com/shipyard-run/blueprints/tree/master/vault-k8s)

Blueprints can either be run from the local filesystem

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shipyard-run/blueprints.git
cd blueprints
yard2 run ./vault-k8s
```

or directly from the GitHub repository

```shell
yard2 run github.com/shipyard-run/blueprints//vault-k8s
```

## Stoping a blueprint

To stop a blueprint use the `yard2 delete` command

```shell
âžœ yard2 delete
