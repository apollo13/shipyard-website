title: Creating Documentation with Shipyard

Shipyard uses [Docusaurs V2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) for its documentation, documentation websites are written in Markdown. All the features of the standard Markdown are available such as the different styling layers. Code blocks, and the ability to embed static assets. In addition to this Shipyard allows you to embed live terminal windows into your documentation that allow you to interact with Shipyard resources.
